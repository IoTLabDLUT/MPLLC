# QoE-driven and traffic-flow-density-based link scheduling algorithm in LLC protocol for HetVNETs
## Introduction
In order to satisfy the requirements of the variety of network applications and the convergence between network physical media in heterogeneous network, a new link scheduling algorithm based on priority of data, link status and traffic flow density (PTLCSA) is proposed by improving traditional data-link layer protocol in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network(VANET). At first, based on the four types of vehicle data in vehicle networking standard, data priority is proposed to indicate the sending weight of different data. Meanwhile, delay factor and load factor are proposed to evaluate link status in real time. Then, based on data priority, delay factor, load factor and traffic flow density, data priority matching degree (DPMD) of link is proposed, and according to Pareto optimal, the upper bound of non-WSM maximal distribution frequency about IEEE 802.11p link is presented, which provide theoretical foundation for data frames to select links. And then, based on DPMD and the upper bound of non-WAVE Short Message(non-WSM) maximal distribution frequency, PTLCSA is designed and realized, and the time complexity of PTLCSA is analyzed in this paper. Finally, simulation results show that on the premise that satisfying the Quality of Experience(QoE) of most network applications, PTLCSA can reduce the delay of security applications and improve the utilization ratio of links.
## PTLCSA Algorithm
Combining the above content, this section puts forward the new concept of data priority matching degree of the link(DPMD), and puts forward the link scheduling algorithm PTLCSA based on delay and load of the link as well as packet priority on the premise that the traffic flow density is considered, to realize the heterogeneous network convergence at LLC layer, ensure communication requirements of other types of applications on the premise of meeting QoE of security applications, and improve the utilization ratio of links.<br>

### Design of PTLCSA Algorithm
In PTLCSA, this paper combines data priority with delay and load of links and traffic flow density of vehicle mobile environment to calculate DPMDs of multiple links in heterogeneous network, to dynamically adjust link load and ensure full utilization of link resources on the premise that transmission requirements of WSM is ensured. The structure chart of the algorithm is shown in as follow, in which obtainment of data type, calculation and comparison of DPMD of each link, and calculation of the maximum distribution frequency of non-WSM are key parts of PTLCSA.<br>

* Obtainment of data type. Whenever the vehicle wants to send packets, the packet will be transported downward to LLC layer from upper * layer, and LLC layer will carry out judgment of data type according to the priority of the packet. If the packet is WSM, it will be distributed directly into the IEEE 802.11p link, to ensure the transmission requirement and QoE of security applications.
* Calculation and comparison of DPMD of each link. If packets of traditional TCP/IP is transported to LLC layer, namely, non-WSM, the current status of links should be measured and analyzed to select the most appropriate link for the packet to transmit.
* Calculation of the maximum distribution frequency of non-WSM. Calculate the maximum distribution frequency and the instantaneous distribution frequency, adn compare them.<br>

## Conclusions
Based on the analysis of researches on heterogeneous network convergence, this paper puts forward a link scheduling algorithm PTLCSA for heterogeneous network based on data priority, link status and traffic flow density aiming at the transmission requirements of security services in VANET. PTLCSA ensures the QoE of non-security services on the premise that transmission requirements of security services are  met at first. Meanwhile, NFV is used to carry out unified management of link resources in VANET, which can improve the utilization ratio of link resources. The simulation result shows that PTLCSA can improve the average utilization ratios of links as well as effectively reduce average transmission delay of WSM in VANET, to utilize link resources fully, improve transmission efficiency of whole network, and  improve the performance of VANET further.
